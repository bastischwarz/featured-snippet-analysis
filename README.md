# featured-snippet-analysis
This is the python project I wrote to investigate the featured snippets regarding their emotions and sentiments, as well as the emotion-sentiment relationship.

The original dataset can be downloaded here: https://zenodo.org/record/3541092

# Ready to use
The additional uploaded data frame was subjected to the analysis and is marked with emotions, sentiment and the highest values per row for sentiment and emotion. 
In addition, the subtract column can be seen where an exploratory analysis was carried out measuring the absolute difference between positive and negative sentiment.
